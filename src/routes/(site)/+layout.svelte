<!-- @component The public chrome for ecxc.ski: an owned, token-driven header, main, and footer in a
     (site) route group. The group is URL-transparent, so these pages keep their paths, and the chrome
     never wraps /admin, which lives outside the group. The chrome is built from `SiteHeader` and
     `SiteFooter`, copy-in components a site owner edits, styled on the public theme (`theme.css`,
     DaisyUI/Tailwind on the cairn token layer); the admin self-styles independently with its own scoped
     sheet. Both stylesheets link by their ?url-resolved URL rather than a static import, so the editor's
     preview frame can link the same assets (the header comment in site.css explains why a static
     import would break that). -->

  <!-- `tabindex="-1"` makes the skip-link target programmatically focusable, so activating "Skip to
       content" moves keyboard focus here, not only the scroll position (WCAG 2.4.1; Firefox and Safari
       move focus to a non-interactive target only when it is focusable). The focus is programmatic, so
       the ring is suppressed below; real controls keep their `:focus-visible` rings. -->
